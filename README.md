## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Front-End Developer** focused on building clean, responsive, and scalable web applications. I enjoy crafting dynamic user interfaces, solving complex UI problems, and creating maintainable code that enhances both user experience and developer efficiency.

I mainly work with **React** and related modern front-end tools, and I have experience developing interactive features like real-time dashboards, Kanban boards, and live chat systems. I care deeply about code quality, usability, and working closely with teams to ship features that matter.

I hold a degree in **Computer and Systems Engineering**, which supports my solid technical foundation, but my real passion lies in front-end development and delivering great user experiences through thoughtful code.

📍 Bogotá, Colombia | 🗓️ September 2023 – Present

At Gecko SAS, I’ve been part of a major front-end migration for [**Audara**](https://es.audara.co/), the company’s contact center platform, helping move the core software from version 4 to version 5 using **React**. My work focuses on improving performance, maintainability, and responsiveness across mobile and tablet views using tools like **Sass**, **Bootstrap**, and **Reactstrap**.

#### 🛠️ Key Responsibilities & Contributions:
- Developed over **20 new CRUD modules** for the Audara Contact Center, maintaining design consistency and adhering to component-based architecture.
- Built and maintained **responsive views** for both new and legacy modules, improving usability across devices.
- Implemented and updated **dynamic reporting systems**, enabling real-time data visualization and improved analytics.
- Refactored and optimized legacy code for better readability, modularity, and long-term maintainability.
- Created interactive components like **real-time dashboards**, **Kanban boards**, and a **custom live chat** with personalized UI.
- Integrated APIs using **Axios** and Node.js backends, including support for **AWS S3** file storage.
- Regularly fixed UI and functional bugs as part of a continuous delivery cycle.
- Followed best practices for **Git version control**, including branching strategies, pull requests, and detailed code reviews.

My work emphasizes clean, modular code and responsive design, always aligning with performance, user experience, and scalability goals.
